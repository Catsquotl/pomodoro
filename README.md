# pomodoro

Excuse the layout. I have yet to learn or look at Markdown.
Anyway this works on my machine. I it should work everywhere if your OS has some ffmpeg lib somehwere.
Going to find out how to chack that programatically. Anyhow. A simple pomodoro timer. 25 minutes and a bell ringing when it's time.
